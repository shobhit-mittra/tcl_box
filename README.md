# TCL_box : mono_synth
This repository is dedicated to learning and improving my TCL scripting and related concepts. This project is inspired by the Udemy course by Kunal Gosh sir titled : 'VSD - TCL programming from novice to expert (parts 1&amp;2)'. Link to the course :  https://www.udemy.com/course/vsd-tcl-programming-from-novice-to-expert

> [!NOTE]
> The [Scripts](Scripts) created during the project take inspiration from the teachings imparted by Kunal sir in his courses so they aren't the exact replica of the scripts developed by him. Throughout this course, my objective is to understand the concepts and the tasks involved and create the scripts based on my understanding. 

The objective and sub-tasks division is provided in the [Objective](Objective) directory. This is a record for the procedure I adopted during the project. I have named my tcl box as `Mono`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Kindly go through the `free course` provided by Kunal sir on the steps to install **open-source EDA tools** that are necessary component in this project and in general a good approach towards understanding the nuances of VLSI Design.
